# Mini-LSM: LSM-Tree Storage Engine in C++17

[![CI](https://github.com/mannanj21/mini-lsm-cpp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mannanj21/mini-lsm-cpp/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A from-scratch C++17 implementation of a Log-Structured Merge Tree (LSM-Tree) — the data structure powering LevelDB, RocksDB, and Apache Cassandra.

**~1.4M write ops/sec · p99 GET latency < 0.006 ms · 37 tests · ASan/TSan clean · CI green**

Inspired by the [Mini-LSM](https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm) tutorial by Alex Chi Z. All components — Block encoding, SSTable builder, WAL, Manifest, iterator stack, and compaction strategies — are independently implemented in C++17.

## What is an LSM Tree?

An LSM Tree is a data structure optimized for **write-heavy workloads**. Instead of writing directly to a sorted on-disk structure (like a B-Tree), all writes first go to an in-memory buffer (MemTable). When the buffer fills, it is flushed to an immutable on-disk file (SSTable). Over time, multiple SSTables accumulate and are periodically merged (compacted) to reclaim space and maintain read performance.

```
Write Path:
  put(k, v) → WAL → MemTable → [freeze] → ImmMemTable → [flush] → SSTable (L0)
                                                                       ↓ compaction
                                                                   SSTable (L1, L2...)

Read Path:
  get(k) → MemTable → ImmMemTables → L0 SSTables → L1+ SSTables (bloom filter skip)
```

## What Makes This Non-Trivial

- **Crash recovery without data loss.** Every write hits the WAL (CRC32-verified) before the MemTable. The Manifest log tracks every flush and compaction. On `open()`, both logs replay to reconstruct exact pre-crash state — verified by a full-lifecycle integration test that writes 1,000 keys, simulates a clean shutdown + restart, and asserts all keys survive (`IntegrationTest.FullLifecycle1000KeysSurvival`).

- **Readers never block writers.** `LsmStorageState` is immutable and reference-counted (`shared_ptr`). Writers atomically swap in a new state object under a write lock; concurrent readers hold a snapshot of the old state until they finish — no reader-writer lock contention on the hot read path.

- **Five-layer iterator stack with correct shadowing semantics.** Reads merge data across MemTable, immutable MemTables, L0 SSTables (individually seekable), and L1+ SSTables (binary-seekable via `SstConcatIterator`). Newer values always shadow older ones; tombstones propagate through the full stack and are dropped only when compacting to the bottom level.

- **Three real compaction strategies.** SimpleLeveled (size-ratio trigger), Tiered (space-amplification trigger), and Leveled (target-size-per-level selection) — each with independent unit tests for trigger conditions and result application.

- **Release-build validated.** The CI pipeline runs with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, catching `NDEBUG` footguns that silence `assert()` side effects. One such bug was found and fixed during development (see [Engineering Notes](#engineering-notes)).

## Using the CLI

Start the REPL:

```bash
./build/mini_lsm_cli
```

Available commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `open <path>` | Open (or create) a database at the given directory |
| `put <key> <value>` | Insert or overwrite a key |
| `get <key>` | Retrieve a value (`(not found)` if absent or deleted) |
| `delete <key>` | Delete a key (write tombstone) |
| `scan <lower> <upper>` | Scan a key range. Use `*` for unbounded. |
| `flush` | Force flush memtable to SSTable on disk |
| `compact` | Force full L0→L1 compaction |
| `quit` / `exit` | Graceful shutdown and exit |

### Example session

```
open /tmp/mydb
OK
put hello world
OK
put foo bar
OK
get hello
world
get missing
(not found)
scan * *
foo bar
hello world
OK
delete foo
OK
flush
OK
compact
OK
quit
```

Re-open the same path — all data survives:

```
open /tmp/mydb
get hello
world
get foo
(not found)
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Immutable State Snapshots (`std::shared_ptr<LsmStorageState>`)
All state mutations create a new `shared_ptr<LsmStorageState>` rather than mutating in-place. Readers snapshot the pointer under a `shared_lock`, so reads never block writes and vice-versa.

### 2. WAL Before MemTable
Every `put` / `del` is written to the WAL before updating the MemTable. On crash, the WAL replays any unflushed records. On clean close, the WAL file is deleted after its MemTable is flushed to SSTable.

### 3. Manifest Log
The Manifest records three event types: `NewMemtable`, `Flush`, `Compaction`. On `open()`, the engine replays all Manifest records to reconstruct `LsmStorageState`, then opens the surviving SST files. This means zero data loss across clean restarts.

### 4. Bloom Filters Skip Reads
Each SSTable has a Bloom filter (FPR < 2%). `get()` on L0/L1 SSTables skips the full block read if the Bloom filter reports absent.

### 5. Iterator Stack
Reads use a layered iterator stack:
```
FusedIterator
  └── LsmIterator (tombstone skip + upper bound)
        └── TwoMergeIterator
              ├── A: MergeIterator<MemTableIterator>  (MemTable + all ImmMemTables)
              └── B: TwoMergeIterator
                    ├── A: MergeIterator<SsTableIterator>  (L0, unsorted)
                    └── B: SstConcatIterator               (L1+, sorted)
```

---

## Component Deep-Dive

### Block
The smallest unit of storage. Keys are prefix-compressed within a block. Each block ends with a CRC32 checksum. The block index stores the first key of each block for binary search.

### SSTable (`.sst`)
An immutable on-disk file containing:
- One or more Blocks
- A Block index (first key per block + file offset)
- A Bloom filter serialized at the end
- Metadata footer with checksum

### MemTable
An in-memory `std::map<std::string, std::string>` guarded by `std::shared_mutex`. Supports concurrent reads via `shared_lock` and exclusive writes via `unique_lock`. Backed by an optional WAL file.

### WAL
A sequential append-only file. Each record: `[key_len:2][key][val_len:2][val][crc32:4]`. Recovery reads until a CRC mismatch or EOF, discarding the last partial record (crash-safe).

### Manifest
A JSON-lines file. Each line: `{"type": "...", ...}` followed by a CRC32. The engine replays all valid records on startup. Corrupt records stop replay (rather than crashing).

### Compaction

| Strategy | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| `NoCompaction` | Testing only. Manual `force_full_compaction()` only. |
| `SimpleLeveled` | Simple size-ratio trigger between adjacent levels. |
| `Tiered` | Write-optimized. Groups SSTables into tiers by size. |
| `Leveled` | Space-efficient. Each level is fully sorted. |

## Engineering Notes

Real bugs found and fixed during implementation — the kind of issues that only surface when you actually build the whole system end-to-end.

### Bug 1 — `apply_compaction_result` incorrectly threw on `ForceFull` tasks

`CompactionController::apply_compaction_result()` dispatched by controller type (SimpleLeveled / Tiered / Leveled / NoCompaction). The issue: `ForceFullCompaction` tasks are **strategy-agnostic** — they don't belong to any controller. The function threw `"NoCompaction controller cannot apply result"` even when the controller was `NoCompaction` and the task was a perfectly valid force-full compaction.

The fix: check `task.type == ForceFull` **before** the controller switch and handle it inline — remove the input SSTables, replace L1 with the output SSTables, filter L0 accordingly. The controller never needs to know about it.

**Why this matters:** This is exactly the class of bug that emerges at integration time when your compaction controller and your compaction executor are designed independently. The controller's job is to *decide when and what* to compact; the executor's job is to *do it and update state*. Mixing those responsibilities causes subtle crashes that only appear on `force_full_compaction()` calls — which are exactly what you'd call in tests.

### Bug 2 — WAL-less MemTable created after freeze when WAL was enabled

`force_freeze_memtable()` created the **replacement** active MemTable via `std::make_shared<MemTable>(id)` regardless of `options.enable_wal`. Consequence: if the DB was opened with WAL enabled, the MemTable was frozen (moved to the immutable list), and a new plain MemTable was created — **without a WAL file**. Any subsequent writes to that MemTable had no crash durability. On restart, those writes would be silently lost.

The fix: `force_freeze_memtable()` respects `options.enable_wal` and calls `MemTable::create_with_wal(id, path_of_wal(id))` for the replacement. The test that caught it: the full-lifecycle integration test (`FullLifecycle1000KeysSurvival`) — it writes, freezes multiple times, closes, reopens, and verifies every key survived.

**Why this matters:** This is the exact failure mode that makes crash recovery implementations unreliable in practice. The WAL exists for durability; if you forget to attach it to newly created MemTables after a freeze, you have a silent hole that doesn't show up until you simulate a crash *between* a freeze and a flush.

### Bug 3 — Side-Effecting Code Inside `assert(...)` Stripped in Release Builds

In `SsTableBuilder::add()`, when a block filled up, the builder called `finish_block()` and then immediately added the new key to the fresh block using `assert(builder_.add(key, value))`. 

In Debug builds (`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`), assertions are active, so `builder_.add()` executed normally and tests passed 100%. However, in Release builds (`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`), `NDEBUG` is defined by CMake. Consequently, the preprocessor completely stripped `assert(...)`, causing `builder_.add(key, value)` to never execute when starting a new block! Every key that triggered a block transition was silently skipped.

The fix: explicitly capture the boolean result into a local variable (`bool added = builder_.add(key, value);`) before asserting (`assert(added); (void)added;`). Additionally, GoogleTest comparisons involving non-owning `KeySlice` objects against stack-allocated `snprintf` buffers were updated to use owning `std::string` containers to prevent stack reclamation issues during evaluation.

**Why this matters:** Placing state-mutating method calls inside `assert()` is a classic trap in systems programming. Always ensure assertions only inspect state or check side-effect-free return values.

## Performance

> Measured on this development machine (Ubuntu 24.04, GCC 13).  
> Build flags: `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`. Benchmarks are opt-in (`-DMINI_LSM_BENCH=ON`), not part of `ctest`.

### Write Throughput (200k keys, key=15B, value=100B)

| Strategy | Ops/sec | MB/sec | Write Amp | On-disk Size |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------|------|
| NoCompaction | ~1,050,000 | ~115 | 0.1× | 1 MB |
| SimpleLeveled | ~1,425,000 | ~156 | 0.3× | 5 MB |
| Tiered | ~1,430,000 | ~157 | 0.3× | 5 MB |
| Leveled | ~1,415,000 | ~155 | 0.3× | 5 MB |

*Write amplification = bytes written to disk / bytes written by user. Lower is better for write-heavy workloads.*

### Read Performance (50k random GETs after 200k keys loaded)

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| GET throughput | ~600,000 ops/sec |
| GET latency p50 | < 0.002 ms |
| GET latency p99 | < 0.006 ms |
| GET latency p999 | < 0.013 ms |
| Miss GET throughput (Bloom filter) | ~510,000 ops/sec |
| Miss GET latency p99 | < 0.004 ms |
| Sequential scan throughput | ~5,150,000 keys/sec |

*Miss GET latency is lower than existing-key GET because Bloom filters reject non-existent keys before any block I/O.*

### Reproducing

```bash
cmake -B build-bench -S . -DMINI_LSM_BENCH=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-bench -j$(nproc)
./build-bench/bench_write
./build-bench/bench_read
```
